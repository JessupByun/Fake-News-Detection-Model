# Fake-News-Detection-Model
A high-accuracy classification model capable of effectively distinguishing between fake and real news articles by utilizing NLP techniques, data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering to combine text-based machine learning applications in the field of misinformation detection 

## Dataset Description

### Fake News Detection Dataset
The dataset is sourced from various real-world news articles, making it a valuable resource for building and evaluating fake news detection models. It includes labeled articles on diverse topics, which allows for broader applicability in detecting fake news across different domains. The dataset is divided into two CSV files:

- **true.csv**: Contains real news articles.
- **fake.csv**: Contains fake or misleading news articles.

Each CSV file contains the following columns:
- **title**: The headline or title of the news article.
- **text**: The body of the news article.
- **subject**: The category of the news (e.g., politics, world news).
- **date**: The publication date of the news article.

### Dataset Usage:
This dataset is ideal for training machine learning models for text classification tasks, particularly binary classification (real vs. fake). It can be used to experiment with various models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and deep learning models like neural networks.
